        <h4>Lord Sidious!!! We intercepted the rebels coordinates, but we were mislead. It seems as if they led us to this leader
        by the name of the Borg Queen. To destroy the Borg Queen, we must surround their ships. Once surrounded, we can destroy their fleet. We only
        have a limited fleet with us. Use our ships wisely to gain control of this battle!</h4>
